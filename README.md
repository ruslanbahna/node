# Node.js Performance Benchmarking

This repository contains a set of performance benchmarks for Node.js, designed to measure the execution speed of various common operations such as computational tasks, data manipulation, and asynchronous operations.

## Overview

The benchmarks are implemented using the [Benchmark.js](https://benchmarkjs.com/) library, which provides a robust framework for timing code execution in JavaScript. The tests are designed to run in a GitHub Actions workflow, ensuring a consistent environment for each test run.

## Benchmarks

The suite includes the following benchmarks:

- **Fibonacci Recursive**: Measures the performance of a recursive function by computing the 30th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Array Sorting**: Evaluates the efficiency of sorting a small array of random numbers.
- **String Manipulation**: Tests the speed of appending characters to a string in a loop.
- **Map Operations**: Assesses the performance of adding and accessing elements in a Map data structure.
- **Set Operations**: Measures the efficiency of adding elements to a Set.
- **JSON Parsing**: Tests the speed of parsing a JSON string into an object.
- **RegExp Matching**: Evaluates the performance of a regular expression match against a sample string.
- **Math Operations**: Measures the speed of performing a square root calculation in a loop.

Additionally, the suite includes three asynchronous benchmarks:

- **Async Operation Example**: A simulated asynchronous task that resolves after a fixed delay, demonstrating how to benchmark asynchronous operations.
- **Simulated Async File Read**: Mimics the process of reading file content asynchronously by resolving after a simulated delay, without the need for actual file I/O.
- **Async Delayed Computation**: Simulates a more CPU-intensive asynchronous task with a fixed delay to represent computation.

## Running the Benchmarks

The benchmarks are designed to run within a GitHub Actions workflow, which is triggered on every push to the repository. The workflow sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and executes the benchmark suite.

To run the benchmarks manually, you can execute the Node.js command provided in the workflow file. Ensure you have Node.js and the Benchmark.js library installed in your environment.

## Interpreting Results

After each benchmark run, the results are logged to the console, displaying the execution time for each test. The suite also identifies the fastest benchmark, providing insights into which operations are most efficient under the current Node.js version and environment settings.

## Customizing Benchmarks

You can customize or extend the benchmark suite by adding new tests to the `suite` object in the Node.js command. Each test should define the code to be benchmarked, and if it's asynchronous, it should use the `defer` option and `deferred.resolve()` to signal completion.

## Conclusion

This benchmarking suite offers a starting point for assessing and comparing the performance of various operations in Node.js. By understanding the execution characteristics of different code snippets, developers can make informed decisions to optimize their applications for speed and efficiency.

Total Execution Time: The total execution time for the benchmark suite is fairly consistent across all environments, with slight variations. This indicates that while individual benchmark performance may vary, the overall performance impact of the container environment on this set of Node.js benchmarks is relatively small.

Conclusion:
The choice of container image can have an impact on specific Node.js operations, particularly those involving data handling and computational tasks. However, the overall execution time of the benchmark suite is relatively consistent across different environments, suggesting that for a broad set of tasks, the impact of the container environment may be minimal. When optimizing for specific operations, it may be beneficial to conduct targeted benchmarks similar to these in the relevant environments to identify any potential performance bottlenecks or optimizations.
